# react-hooks

React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components, simplifying how you write and manage your code. Introduced in React 16.8, they allow you to use features like state and lifecycle methods without writing class components. The useState Hook lets you add state to your functional components, returning an array with the current state value and a function to update it. For example, you can create a simple counter component that increments a count value each time a button is clicked. The useEffect Hook lets you perform side effects in your components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, and manual DOM manipulations. It runs after the component renders and can be configured to run only when certain values change. For instance, you can fetch data from an API and update the state with the received data. By using Hooks, you can write cleaner, more understandable code and avoid the complexities of class components, making your React development more efficient and enjoyable.
